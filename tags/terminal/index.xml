      <description>Some months ago i started using neovim, because of it&amp;rsquo;s strong defaults, and modern terminal features.
If you already installed Neovim Nightly, please skip to getting started
What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:
